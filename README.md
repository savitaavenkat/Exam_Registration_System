Motivation:
-----------
- A simple application developed during my first year of bachelors in 2013 as a side project to understand the full working of a system, starting from a backend database, to a webserver to serve the requests back and forth, to a simple web front end to display the results of any operation performed through the system to the user in a meaningful way.

Files & Folders:
----------------
- Software Requirement Specification Document.doc: It contains a complete SRS report written for the system designed.
- Project Report.docx: Describes the system designed in depth with an intent for future development to be made easy.
- Code: This folder consists of the entire codebase for the application. However, a MySQL DB instance is needed for the code to work locally in your system.
